# Optional touchscreen white balance

A per-device profile at `/etc/pi-home/display-white-balance.json` applies RGB
multipliers to the main GTK application window. The profile is separate from
replaceable releases; application updates and reboot preserve it. Missing,
unreadable, oversized or invalid profiles fall back to the original colours.
Other devices have no correction unless their owner creates a profile.

On the measured official 10-inch Touch Display 2, the active RP1 DSI controller
exposed no gamma LUT or CTM. Therefore this is a GTK rendering adjustment, not a
hardware ICC calibration. The desktop/web browser, first-boot wizard and separate
native popup surfaces are outside the main-window correction. GTK acceleration on
the real Pi still requires acceptance testing; the render check verifies CPU/Cairo
snapshot pixels in CI, not GPU behaviour or performance on the touchscreen.

The owner selected the first measured correction as visually sufficient:

```json
{"rgb_gains": [0.9665, 0.8712, 1.0]}
```

Measured uncorrected white: x=0.319662, y=0.363352. First corrected white patch:
x=0.311595, y=0.325958. D65 reference: x=0.3127, y=0.3290. Full profiling and precise
greyscale correction were deliberately not pursued. Sensor measurements used
Argyll's base non-refresh mode without a panel-specific spectral correction, so
these are practical white-balance readings, not certified colour accuracy.

## Activate after updating the application

Close any temporary measurement window with Ctrl+C in its SSH terminal, then run
these commands one at a time on the Pi:

```sh
printf '%s\n' '{"rgb_gains":[0.9665,0.8712,1.0]}' | sudo tee /etc/pi-home/display-white-balance.json
```

```sh
sudo rc-service pi-home-display restart
```

For Raspberry Pi OS, use `sudo systemctl restart pi-bus-native` instead. The
profile is read at display startup. Test ordinary white text, grey surfaces,
artwork, scrolling and touch on the real device after activation; no further
instrument readings are required for this owner-selected practical adjustment.
Do not reuse these gains on a different panel without checking its white balance.

## Disable

```sh
sudo mv /etc/pi-home/display-white-balance.json /etc/pi-home/display-white-balance.json.disabled
sudo rc-service pi-home-display restart
```

Use the systemd restart command above on Raspberry Pi OS. This restores the
original rendering and retains the profile for later use. Editing the gains never
changes source artwork, backend data, or browser colours. Limits are 0.1–1.0 per
channel; the matrix leaves alpha unchanged and applies no offset to black.
